        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hello! 

        I'm a first-year Computer Science student with a growing passion for technology and programming. Currently, I'm diving into the world of coding, software development, and problem-solving, and I'm excited to continue building my skills throughout my academic journey.
        
        I have some experience working with WordPress, where I learned the basics of website development and gained an understanding of how web technologies work.
        
        I’m passionate about how technology is transforming the automobile industry, from autonomous vehicles to electric cars.
        
        I’m eager to connect with professionals, students, and enthusiasts in tech, software development, and automotive innovation. Let’s collaborate and share ideas!</p>
